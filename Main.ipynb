They employ a multi-layered structure consisting of a thin polymer foil perforated with microscale holes. When charged particles traverse the GEM, they ionize the gas atoms, creating electron-ion pairs. The liberated electrons drift towards the holes in the foil, entering a high-field region known as the \"ionization region.\" In this region, the electric field is intensified, triggering secondary ionization and initiating an electron avalanche. This exponential growth of electrons leads to significant signal amplification, making GEMs highly sensitive detectors."

Acrylic rod light guides are glued with plastic bonding adhesive to both ends of the bars allowing for close packing of the detector within a constrained space. Coupled with the light guides are PMTs, resulting in 180 readout channels for the TH. The signals from the PMTs are extracted to custom made front-end cards based on CERN’s NINO ASIC, a low power front-end amplifier discriminator chip which allows for an 8-channel input signal charge measurement. The signals from the front end cards are then readout to VMA-based multi-hit TDCs (time-to-digital converters). With this setup, the vertical bar number and the time difference between the two signals from the PMTs on the bar can be used to determine the raw position of an electron that hits the TH."

They employ a multi-layered structure consisting of a thin polymer foil perforated with microscale holes. When charged particles traverse the GEM, they ionize the gas atoms, creating electron-ion pairs. The liberated electrons drift towards the holes in the foil, entering a high-field region known as the \"ionization region.\" In this region, the electric field is intensified, triggering secondary ionization and initiating an electron avalanche. This exponential growth of electrons leads to significant signal amplification, making GEMs highly sensitive detectors."

The signals from the PMTs are extracted to custom made front-end cards based on CERN’s NINO ASIC, a low power front-end amplifier discriminator chip which allows for an 8-channel input signal charge measurement. The signals from the front end cards are then readout to VMA-based multi-hit TDCs (time-to-digital converters).
